            Subject to the provisions hereof, this Agreement shall remain in

            Application, unless Merchant gives written notice of termination as
            to this Agreement at least 60 (sixty) days prior to the expiration
            of the Term or any extension or renewals thereof. If no term is
            specified on the Merchant Application, subject to the provisions
            hereof, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until
            Merchant gives not less than 60 (sixty) days’ prior written notice
            to CARDSE to terminate it (in either case, the “Term”).
          </li>
          <li>
            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the
            event that a Term is specified in the Merchant Application and
            Merchant terminates this Agreement in breach of this Clause 2, all
            monthly Fees (including any charges and expenses in consideration of
            CARDSE’s performance of its obligations) assessed to Merchant under
            this Agreement and due to CARDSE for the remainder of the then
            existing Term of this Agreement, including all minimum monthly Fee
            commitments (if any), shall be immediately due and payable to
            CARDSE, and Merchant hereby authorizes CARDSE to accelerate the
            payment of all such monthly Fees (including any charges and expenses
            in consideration of CARDSE’s performance of its obligations) and to
            deduct the total amount from Merchant’s Account, or to otherwise
            withhold the total amount from amounts due to Merchant from CARDSE,
            immediately on or after the effective date of termination.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the Merchant Account does not contain sufficient funds for the
          debit or the amount cannot be withheld by CARDSE from amounts due to
          Merchant, Merchant shall pay CARDSE the amount due within 10 (ten)
          days of the date of CARDSE’s invoice for the same. The payment of
          accelerated monthly fees as described herein is not a penalty, but
          rather is hereby agreed by the Parties to be a reasonable amount of
          liquidated damages to compensate CARDSE for their termination expenses
          and all other damages under the circumstances in which such amounts
          would be payable. Such amounts shall not be in lieu of but shall be in
          addition to any payment obligations for Services already provided
          hereunder (or that CARDSE may continue to provide), which shall be an
          additional cost, and any and all other damages to which CARDSE may be
          entitled hereunder.]

          <li>
            Any termination shall not affect any liabilities incurred prior to
            the termination nor any provision of this Agreement expressed or
            intended to survive, or to be effective from, termination. In
            particular, but without prejudice to the foregoing, Clauses 8, 9,
